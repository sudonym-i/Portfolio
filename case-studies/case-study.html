        <h1><span >Summary</span></h1>
        <span class="case-study-text">
            Sitemap Gecko emerged from a deep understanding of user needs and frustrations, 
            driving us to design a solution that revolutionizes the sitemap creation process. 
            Through empathetic research, clear problem definition, iterative prototyping, and 
            rigorous testing, we created a Figma plugin that streamlines workflows, enhances 
            user experience, and integrates seamlessly with design tools. The success of 
            Sitemap Gecko underscores the power of user-centric design in delivering impactful solutions.

        <h1><span >Introduction</span></h1>
        <span class="case-study-text">   
            Sitemap Gecko, a Figma plugin developed by ACME Corp, revolutionizes the process of 
            generating sitemaps. This case study will delve into the journey of conceptualizing, 
            designing, and launching Sitemap Gecko, outlining each stage of the UX design process.

        <h1><span >Empathise</span></h1>
        <span class="case-study-text">   
            During the empathize stage, our team immersed themselves in understanding the pain points 
            and requirements of UX designers and web developers who frequently create sitemaps. We 
            conducted interviews, surveys, and observed user workflows to gain deep insights into their 
            needs, desires, and motivations. This process revealed frustrations with existing 
            tools' usability, efficiency, and integration with design workflows. We empathized with 
            users' struggles, which became the driving force behind our design decisions.

        <h1><span >Define</span></h1>
        <span class="case-study-text">
            In the define stage, we synthesized the data collected during the empathize stage to 
            identify key problem areas and define clear design challenges. We distilled user insights 
            into actionable problem statements, such as the need for a seamless integration between 
            sitemap creation and design tools, intuitive navigation, and customizable templates. These 
            insights framed our design problem, guiding us towards solutions that directly addressed 
            users' pain points.

        <h1><span >Prototype</span></h1>
        <span class="case-study-text">
            Armed with insights from the empathize and define stages, we entered the prototype stage 
            to explore potential solutions. We created prototypes ranging from low-fidelity wireframes 
            to high-fidelity interactive mockups, iterating rapidly to refine our designs. The prototypes 
            focused on streamlining the sitemap creation process, enhancing user experience through intuitive 
            interactions, and ensuring seamless integration with Figma. Continuous user feedback guided 
            us towards refining and iterating on our designs until we reached a solution that met users' 
            needs and expectations.

        <h1><span >Test</span></h1>
        <span class="case-study-text padding-bottom">
            In the test stage, we evaluated our prototypes to validate their effectiveness in addressing 
            users' pain points. We conducted usability tests, gathered feedback from beta testers, and 
            iterated on our designs based on user insights. Through rigorous testing, we identified areas 
            for improvement, refined user flows, and fine-tuned features to enhance usability and satisfaction.
             This iterative process ensured that Sitemap Gecko met the needs of its target users and delivered
              a seamless sitemap creation experience.
