        <h1><span >Carpentry Contractor</span></h1>
        <span class="sub-sections-text-black">
            Working as an independent subcontractor in construction, particularly as a wood framer, has taught me invaluable skills in communication and teamwork that extend well beyond the job site. This role has given me the opportunity to work closely with diverse teams, all while maintaining a high degree of independence and responsibility. Here’s how that experience has sharpened my abilities to communicate and collaborate effectively:
            <br><br>
<h2>1. Clear Communication with Clients and Contractors</h2>
As a subcontractor, I often act as the bridge between the primary contractor and the client. This requires me to ensure that both sides are on the same page regarding timelines, project scope, and materials. I learned to communicate clearly and concisely, especially when it came to discussing changes, delays, or challenges that arose during the framing process. This ability to articulate complex issues in a way that is understandable to everyone involved ensures that expectations are set and met, reducing the chance of misunderstandings or conflicts.
<br><br>
<h2>2. Collaborating with a Diverse Team</h2>
Construction projects often involve a range of professionals—from general contractors to electricians, plumbers, and fellow subcontractors. As a wood framer, I had to work with all these professionals to ensure our work aligned seamlessly. Whether it was coordinating framing with electrical placements or working alongside other crews to meet deadlines, I learned to adapt to different communication styles and be proactive in finding solutions. This constant collaboration with various experts taught me the importance of flexibility and respecting other trades, which ultimately benefits the project as a whole.
<br><br>
<h2>3. Team Leadership and Responsibility</h2>
Though I was an independent subcontractor, I often had to lead smaller teams of laborers or apprentices. This experience gave me the chance to practice clear instruction and delegation. I had to ensure that everyone understood their tasks and knew how to execute them safely and efficiently. Effective leadership meant checking in regularly with my team, answering questions, and providing guidance when needed. By maintaining open lines of communication, I was able to keep everyone motivated and focused on achieving project milestones.
<h2>4. Client Satisfaction and Professionalism</h2>
Finally, working directly with clients and contractors taught me the importance of professional and respectful communication. My reputation as a subcontractor was built on delivering quality work on time, but just as important was my ability to maintain a positive relationship with all parties. Whether discussing concerns, providing updates, or explaining technical aspects of the project, I learned that clear, polite communication leads to stronger, long-term relationships and helps build trust and credibility.

        <h1><span >Innovation for Health Hackathon</span></h1>
        <span class="sub-sections-text-black"> 
            <br>
            Participating in the "Innovation for Health" hackathon, a health and computer science-focused event, was an incredibly transformative experience that significantly helped me develop strong communication and teamwork skills. Collaborating with a diverse team of individuals, each bringing their own expertise and perspectives, pushed me to grow both professionally and personally. Here’s how this experience helped me hone those skills:
            <br><br>
            <h2> 1. Collaborating Across Disciplines</h2> <br>
            The "Innovation for Health" hackathon brought together participants from various fields—healthcare, computer science, design, and more. This mix of expertise meant that communication was key to ensuring everyone understood one another, regardless of background. I had to bridge the gap between technical language and healthcare terminology, making sure that each team member’s input was clear and understood by all. This process taught me how to communicate complex ideas in simple terms, ensuring everyone was on the same page.
            <br>
            Working with professionals from different fields also helped me develop the skill of listening actively and respectfully, as I had to understand and appreciate perspectives outside of my own. I learned how to tailor my communication to suit the context and audience, which greatly improved my ability to collaborate effectively in cross-functional teams.
            <br><br>
            <h2>    2. Adapting to Changing Ideas and Feedback</h2> <br>
            One of the main challenges of a hackathon is that ideas and solutions evolve rapidly as the project progresses. We had to be agile and open to pivoting as we received feedback from mentors, judges, and team members. This required constant, clear communication to make sure everyone was aligned on the changes and improvements we were making. I learned to provide constructive feedback in a way that encouraged creativity and collaboration, and to receive feedback without taking it personally, focusing instead on how it could improve the project.
            <br>
            Being adaptable also meant working with team members who had different problem-solving approaches. Through open communication and mutual respect, I learned how to leverage our diverse strengths and incorporate various ideas into our solution, creating a more robust and innovative product.
            <br><br>
            <h2>    3. Navigating Pressure and Tight Deadlines</h2> <br>
            Hackathons are often intense, with long hours and tight deadlines. This pressure could lead to stress, but it also provided valuable opportunities for improving my communication under pressure. I learned how to maintain clear and concise communication even when things were hectic. When issues arose—whether technical glitches or disagreements over direction—being able to remain calm, listen to others, and express ideas clearly was essential to keeping the team focused.
            <br>
            Working in such a high-pressure environment also taught me the importance of staying positive and solution-oriented. When faced with setbacks, I learned how to communicate constructively, ensuring the team stayed motivated and worked together to find solutions.
